# SLAL (Simple Linear Algebra Library)

## Why is it named _slal_?
Well I am not the best when it comes to naming things, but I wanted to name this \
library that have the following criteria.
1. Easy to type. \
If the library has a long and hard to type name, it would be annoying to use and develop.
2. Name that makes sense. \
I could have named this library something _cool and attractiveâ„¢_, but I wanted to \
name this library that has something to do with linear algebra.

## What is slal?
slal is a simple linear algebra library that computes vectors and matrices __parallel by default__! \
Which brings the benefit of __faster computation__ with the drawback of higher power usage.

## What are the 4 branches in this repository?
The 4 branchs (`main`, `devel`, `testing`, `documentation`) are individually used for the \
following reasons.
- `main`: \
The main release branch. Features that have been fully implemented and tested \
are in this branch.
- `devel`: \
Features that are being implemented are going to be in this branch. \
Code that is unique in this branch are not yet tested.
- `testing`: \
Features that have been implemented in `devel` and are being tested are in this branch.
- `documentation`: \
Features that been implemented and tested are in this branch. \
Documentation are going to be added in this branch. \
Codes that have been documented are going to `main`. \
__Note__: _Not EVERY Feature_ are being documented.
